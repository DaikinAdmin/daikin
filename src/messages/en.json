        "title": "Dlaczego warto wybrać Daikin Emura?",
        "subtitle": "Daikin Emura łączy elegancki design z zaawansowaną technologią, oferując najwyższy komfort i wyjątkową jakość pracy. System oczyszczania usuwa z powietrza drobne cząsteczki i zapachy, a inteligentne czujniki dostosowują działanie urządzenia do warunków w pomieszczeniu, kierując łagodny, równomierny strumień powietrza bez niekomfortowych podmuchów. Konstrukcja pozwala także szybciej dogrzać wnętrze w razie potrzeby, a cicha praca sprawia, że klimatyzator pozostaje niemal niezauważalny. Współczynnik efektywności sezonowej podaje bardziej realne informacje dotyczące wydajności pompy ciepła powietrze-powietrze w całym sezonie grzewczym lub chłodniczym. Etykieta obejmuje klasyfikacje od A+++ do D. Daikin Emura uzyskał etykietę najwyższej efektywności energetycznej."
